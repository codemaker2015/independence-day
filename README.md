# Independence Day

India is a country of vast religion, customs, traditions, culture and language. Every part of the country carries a different aura. Even though there are differences, all of us are united by India. We are Indians. We own to what we are today due to the struggles and sacrifices that our soldiers made to  gain us our Independence. We must never forget their sacrifices and honour them. Enjoy this beautiful Independence Day!

"At the dawn of history India started on her unending quest, and trackless centuries are filled with her striving and the grandeur of her success and her failures. Through good and ill fortune alike she has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which gave her strength." - Jawaharlal Nehru

Ours is not a drive for power, but purely a nonviolent fight for India's independence - Mahatma Gandhi
